1. Cluttered Commit History
Problem: Regular merge commits can clutter the commit history, making it difficult to follow the development progress.
Solution: By rebasing the feature branch before merging, this strategy keeps the commit history linear and clean, while still marking the merge points with a merge commit.
2. Conflict Resolution
Problem: Merging branches without rebasing can lead to frequent and complex conflicts, especially in long-running feature branches.
Solution: Rebasing the feature branch onto the latest main branch ensures that conflicts are resolved before the final merge, reducing the likelihood of conflicts during the merge process.
3. Tracking Feature Integration
Problem: Fast-forward merges do not create merge commits, making it hard to track when and where features were integrated.
Solution: This strategy creates a merge commit, clearly indicating when a feature branch was integrated into the main branch, which is useful for tracking and auditing purposes.
4. Maintaining Context
Problem: Pure rebasing can lose the context of when and why branches were merged.
Solution: The merge commit provides a clear marker in the history, preserving the context of the integration while maintaining a linear history.
5. Simplifying History for Review
Problem: A non-linear history with many merge commits can be hard to review and understand.
Solution: A semi-linear history simplifies the review process by presenting a straightforward, linear sequence of commits, making it easier to understand the progression of changes.

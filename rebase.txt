Cleaning Up Commit History:

Squash Commits: Combine multiple commits into a single cohesive commit to make the history cleaner and more readable.
Reword Commits: Change commit messages to be more descriptive or to follow a certain format.
Updating Feature Branches:

Bringing Changes from the Main Branch: Update your feature branch with the latest changes from the main branch (e.g., main or master) to ensure it is up to date before merging.
Avoiding Merge Commits: Instead of merging the main branch into your feature branch, you can rebase your feature branch onto the main branch, resulting in a linear history without merge commits.
Maintaining a Linear Project History:

Keeping a Linear History: Rebase helps maintain a linear commit history, which can make the project history easier to understand and navigate.
Replaying Commits: Rebase replays commits from one branch onto another, effectively rewriting the project history in a linear fashion.
Resolving Conflicts:

Interactive Rebasing: Use git rebase -i (interactive rebase) to manually resolve conflicts and reorder, squash, or edit commits.
Conflict Resolution: When rebasing, you can resolve conflicts as they arise, which can sometimes be simpler than resolving conflicts during a merge.
Combining Multiple Branches:

Consolidating Changes: If you have multiple branches with related changes, you can rebase them onto a single branch to consolidate those changes before merging them into the main branch.
Rebasing Before Merging:

Rebasing to Main: Rebase your feature branch onto the main branch before merging to ensure a clean history and to test for conflicts early.
Ensuring Tests Pass: By rebasing onto the latest main branch, you can ensure that your changes are tested against the most recent codebase.
Fixing Mistakes:

Correcting Commits: Use interactive rebase to edit, reorder, or remove incorrect commits from your branch.
Splitting Commits: If a single commit contains multiple logical changes, you can split it into multiple commits using interactive rebase
